Error function:
The void Error() function returns a string to communicate to the user that the user input is incorrect and tells the user to enter another input.
By using a while loop, the Error loop will be continuous as long as the user does not choose one of the provided choices. The while loop has to 
be written for each use.

Infinite ability to go back and forth:
When the option of going back to the previous "page" or previous question is provided, the user can continuously go back and forth. 
For example, the user can continuously go to the character page then go back to choose another character then back again to the character page.
